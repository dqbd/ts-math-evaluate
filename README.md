# TS-Math-Evaluate

`ts-math-evaluate` is a type-level library for evaluating mathematical expressions in TypeScript, developed as a master thesis, implementing core mathematical operations and the accompanying evaluator, demonstrating the power of the TypeScript type system and the ability to perform complex meta-programming within the type system itself. 

A comprehensive guide to the TypeScript syntax and type-level programming techniques is provided to broaden the understanding of the capabilities of this language, seen [here (ctufit-thesis.pdf)](https://github.com/dqbd/ts-math-evaluate/blob/c7e71ed156ba0349e658ae805684cf46ecdc744d/thesis/ctufit-thesis.pdf). 

## Installation

```bash
npm install ts-math-evaluate
```

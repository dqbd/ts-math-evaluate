\section{Performance testing}

Advanced utility types do have a significant strain on type checking and can have a negative impact on the developer experience with worse latency of language services and longer build times when building with \code{tsc}. The performance test suite has been created to measure the impact of various implemented math operations on type-checking performance. 

Two metrics are measured in the performance test suite: the \say{check time} obtained from extended diagnostics when compiling via \code{tsc} and the number of type instantiations performed when evaluating utility types.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Difference between operations, execution time + number of created types \code{yarn tsc --noEmit --incremental false --generateTrace trace --extendedDiagnostics --listFiles -p tsconfig.json --explainFiles}
  \item Comparison between other libraries (arielhs/ts-arithmetic)
\end{itemize}

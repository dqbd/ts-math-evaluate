There are multiple basic implementations of math operations in TypeScript. Tasks regarding basic math operations are even part of the TypeChallenges collection[@TypechallengesTypechallenges2023]. However, most of them only work on integers, as they work on tuple expansion, which will be further discussed in the implementation part of this thesis.

Nevertheless, multiple libraries in the [npm]{acronym-label="npm" acronym-form="singular+abbrv"} registry provide basic math calculations within the TypeScript type system, but none provide a fully typed parser of mathematical expressions. Some of the libraries found do provide type utilities that operate on floating-point numbers instead of integers, such as `type-fest` [@sorhusSindresorhusTypefest2023] or `typescript-lodash`[@kawayilinlinKawayiLinLinTypescriptlodash2023]. The most comprehensive implementation of math operations can be found in the `ts-arithmetic` library [@arielTypeLevelArithmetic2023], which provides a fully typed implementation of division.

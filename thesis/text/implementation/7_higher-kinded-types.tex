\section{Higher kinded types}

\acrfull{hkt}, also known as higher-order types, are a powerful type system language feature that enables describing expressive generic types by allowing accepting other generic types as type arguments. To demonstrate, consider the following Listing \ref{lst:duplicate-generic-types}. As can be seen, all three generic types do essentially the same type instantiation, only with different type constructors.

\begin{listing}[ht]
  \begin{minted}{TypeScript}
type Foo<O> = O extends string ? `Foo<${O}>` : never
type Bar<O> = O extends string ? `Bar<${O}>` : never
type Baz<O> = O extends string ? `Baz<${O}>` : never

type MapValuesWithFoo<O> = { [K in keyof O]: Foo<O[K]> }
type MapValuesWithBar<O> = { [K in keyof O]: Bar<O[K]> }
type MapValuesWithBaz<O> = { [K in keyof O]: Baz<O[K]> }
\end{minted}
  \caption{Duplicate generic types}\label{lst:duplicate-generic-types}
\end{listing}

With \acrshort{hkt}s, it is possible to define a single higher-order generic type, that accepts a type constructor as an argument. The type constructor is then applied to each property of the object type. The result is shown in Listing \ref{lst:proposed-hkt-syntax}.

\begin{listing}[ht]
  \begin{minted}{TypeScript}
type MapValuesWith<O, T<~>> = { [K in keyof O]: T<O[K]> }

type MapValuesWithFoo<O> = MapValuesWith<O, Foo>;
type MapValuesWithBar<O> = MapValuesWith<O, Bar>;
type MapValuesWithBaz<O> = MapValuesWith<O, Baz>;
\end{minted}
  \caption{Proposed HKT syntax in TypeScript}\label{lst:proposed-hkt-syntax}
\end{listing}

With higher kinded types, it is possible to declare a monad generic type \cite{wadlerMonadsFunctionalProgramming1993} or applicative functors \cite{mcbrideApplicativeProgrammingEffects2008}, design patterns commonly found in functional programming languages such as Haskell or Scala.

However, as of writing, higher-kinded types are not natively supported by TypeScript \cite{DocumentationTypeScriptFunctional}. Fortunately, it is possible to emulate the behaviour of higher kinded types.

There are two ways to achieve the behaviour of \acrshort{hkt}. One such way can be achieved by implementing lightweight higher-kinded polymorphism \cite{yallopLightweightHigherKindedPolymorphism2014} and defunctionalisation of kinds \cite{reynoldsDefinitionalInterpretersHigherorder1972}, a technique for translating higher-order programs into a first-order language. The main idea is to create a mapping of unique names of type constructors to their implementations. Afterwards, a \code{Kind} utility converts the name and the appropriate type argument to the corresponding higher-kinded type. An example can be seen in Listing \ref{lst:emulating-hkt-legacy}.

\begin{listing}[ht]
  \begin{minted}{TypeScript}
type URItoKind<A> = { "Foo": Foo<A>; "Bar": Bar<A>; "Baz": Baz<A> }
type URI = keyof URItoKind<unknown>
type Kind<F extends URI, A> = URItoKind<A>[F];

type MapValuesWith<O, Type extends URI> = Kind<Type, O>
\end{minted}
  \caption{\acrshort{hkt} emulation using lightweight higher-kinded polymorphism}\label{lst:emulating-hkt-legacy}
\end{listing}

This method is historically used in libraries for typed functional programming such as \code{fp-ts} \cite{GcantiFptsFunctional}. Unfortunately, this method requires a central registry of URIs that are used to identify the appropriate type constructor and extendability based on module augmentation is limited.

The other possible method for implementing \acrshort{hkt}s is by utilising the properties of type unification with \code{this}. This method is thoroughly used in HOTscript \cite{vergnaudHigherOrderTypeScriptHOTScript2023} and a simplified implementation can be seen in Listing \ref{lst:emulating-hkt}.

\begin{listing}[ht]
  \begin{minted}{TypeScript}
interface Fn { input: unknown; output: unknown; }

type Call<fn extends Fn, input> = (fn & { input: input })["output"];

interface Foo extends Fn {
  output: this["input"] extends infer O extends string ? `Foo<${O}>` : never;
}

interface Bar extends Fn {
  output: this["input"] extends infer O extends string ? `Bar<${O}>` : never;
}

interface Baz extends Fn {
  output: this["input"] extends infer O extends string ? `Baz<${O}>` : never;
}

type MapValuesWith<O, Wrap extends Fn> = {
  [K in keyof O]: Call<Wrap, O[K]>
}
\end{minted}
  \caption{Type unification for emulating \acrshort{hkt}s}\label{lst:emulating-hkt}
\end{listing}

The most popular implementation of the latter method, HOTScript, exposes most of the core functionality of the library as a public facing API. Thus, an additional public facing API for mathematical operations has been exposed for users of HOTScript, extending the library with an advanced mathematical expression evaluator implemented in this work.

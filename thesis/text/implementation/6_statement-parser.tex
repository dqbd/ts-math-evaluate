\section{Statement parser \& evaluator}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Architecture of parser: lexer, parser, evaluator
  \item Decision why we are not evaluating directly in the parser - reduce the number of type instantiations
  \item Mention alternative algorithms (Shunting-yard algorithm, Pratt parser) and the decision why parser is a better solution - create a more generic parser implementation which is easier to extend
  \item Description of the math grammar, how we ensure operator precedence and left/right-associativity
  \item Mention creating a custom code generator for detecting valid strings of a LL(1) grammar
  \item Namespaces and default types instead of enums
  \item Behavior of never type and the need to create a custom error type (duck typing)
\end{itemize}

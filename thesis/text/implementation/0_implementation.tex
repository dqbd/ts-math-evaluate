\chapter{Implementation}

This chapter delves into the implementation of the math expression evaluator using the TypeScript type system. The work being done in this thesis is realised into two major parts: the realisation of mathematical operations and parsing and evaluating string literals with a mathematical expression. The limitations and workarounds for TypeScript literal types are discussed, and by the end of this chapter, readers should gain a deeper understanding of the TypeScript type system when applied to non-trivial problem domains.

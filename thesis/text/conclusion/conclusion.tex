\section{Advantages and disadvantages of TS}

Practical uses of implemented meta TypeScript 

- Numerical operations: Describing exact numbers for proper type hinting (media-queries), type-level unit conversion 
- Generic bullshit: enhance type safety and code correctness 
- Parser: easily introduce a parser for a different grammar, such as JSON or other DSLs with an appropriate lexer.
- Crazy ideas: more complex generic types, such as a type-level implementation of a neural network for recognising digits \cite{arshLilnasySee2023}.

- The benchmarking utility can be useful for library maintainers to monitor potential performance regressions when working with multiple contributors. 


Truncation issues
- noErrorTruncation: true
- defaultMaximumTrucationLength
- manually recreate intermediate types 

Hidden and cryptic errors -> need to deep resolve 

\begin{listing}[ht]
\caption{Deep resolve}\label{lst:deep-resolve}
\begin{minted}{TypeScript}
type Resolve<T> = T extends Function ? T : { [K in keyof T]: T[K] };
\end{minted}
\end{listing}

Theoretical and practical shortcomings of the TypeScript type system
- Lack of built-in type-level assertions and checks 
- Lack of optional / named generics (https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/26349)
- Lack of higher kinded types (can be emulated)
- Lack of higher level type level arithmetic operations (can be emulated, ofc...)

Limitations:
- crossProductUnion depth limit: 100000
- instantiationDepth limit: 100
- instantiationCount limit: 5000000
- types related to discriminated type depth limit: 25 combinations
- complex subtype checks: thrown if about 1M subtypes left to check
- maximum tuple size (10000)
- numeric literal limitation (2 ** 53 - 1)

- Hard limitations for type instantiation depth, size of a tuple limitation etc. 
- Possible footguns with type inference and gradual type system (function overloading)

- Relative slow type checking (checker is written in TypeScript to dogfood the language, but a lot can be achieved by switching to a different language, such as Rust, see the upcoming stc project \cite{Stc2023})
